# Cardio-Care

Cardio-Care is a comprehensive project aimed at detecting heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The project implements three different algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. Each of these algorithms has been fine-tuned to provide the best possible accuracy:

- **Logistic Regression:** Achieved an accuracy of 83.69%. This algorithm is suitable for binary classification tasks and is known for its efficiency and performance in distinguishing between two classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Achieved an accuracy of 67.75%. KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points.
- **Decision Tree:** Achieved an accuracy of 78.98%. This algorithm uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, making it useful for both classification and regression tasks.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Detection:** Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **User Input Form:** Collects necessary patient information for the prediction.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Displays the performance of different algorithms used.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and testing of machine learning models.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For creating the front-end of the web application.
- **Streamlit:** For building and deploying the web application.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms.
