    Cardio Care is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize cardiovascular disease detection. Leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree models, Cardio Care provides a comprehensive and accurate assessment of an individual's risk for cardiovascular disease.
                
    Our application aims to empower users with the knowledge and tools necessary to proactively manage their heart health. By simply inputting key health metrics such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors, Cardio Care generates a personalized risk assessment report. This report not only identifies the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease but also provides valuable insights and recommendations for preventative measures.

    What sets Cardio Care apart is its commitment to accuracy and user-friendliness. Our machine learning models have been trained on a robust dataset, ensuring reliable and consistent results. The intuitive interface makes it easy for users to navigate and understand their results, promoting better understanding and engagement with their heart health.
                
    Join us in the fight against cardiovascular disease. With Cardio Care, early detection and prevention are within reach, paving the way for healthier hearts and lives.

            ### Precautions to Reduce High Blood Pressure:
            1. **Reduce Salt Intake:** Aim to eat less salt by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to meals.
            2. **Eat a Balanced Diet:** Focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.
            3. **Exercise Regularly:** Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or cycling.
            4. **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce blood pressure.
            5. **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.
            6. **Quit Smoking:** Smoking increases blood pressure and heart rate.
            7. **Manage Stress:** Practice stress-reducing techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.
            8. **Monitor Your Blood Pressure:** Keep track of your blood pressure at home and see your doctor regularly.
